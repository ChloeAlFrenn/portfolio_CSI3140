        <h2>Hotel Reservation Website</h3>
        <p>
          As part of the Database 1 course at the University of Ottawa, our team
          of three members designed and developed a hotel reservation website.
          This project integrated a PostgreSQL database to manage and retrieve
          reservation data and utilized modern web technologies for a seamless
          user experience. The front end was built with React, providing an
          intuitive interface for users to book hotel rooms, while the back end
          was developed with Java and Spring Boot, ensuring efficient handling
          of requests. It includes the following technologies:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>React:</b> Used to build the dynamic and responsive front-end user
            interface.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Java 19:</b> Served as the primary programming language for the back
            end, offering a reliable and high-performance environment for
            server-side logic.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Spring Boot:</b> simplified the development of the back end, providing
            various features like embedded servers and simplified dependency
            management.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>PostgreSQL:</b> Chosen for the database layer, PostgreSQL offered robust
            and scalable database management capabilities, ensuring efficient
            data storage and retrieval.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Maven:</b> Used for managing project dependencies and building the
            Java-based back end, ensuring a consistent and reproducible build
            process.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Node.js:</b>: Essential for running the front-end development
            environment, facilitating the installation and management of
            dependencies and serving the React application during development.

      <h2>Tic Tac Toe Game</h2>
      <p>
        Developed in a team of 2 as a single-player game for the CSI3140 course at the
        University of Ottawa, this Tic Tac Toe game showcases proficiency in
        HTML, CSS, PHP, AJAX, JSON, and JavaScript. The game consists of a 3x3 grid where the player and the computer 
        take turns clicking squares to place their mark (X for the player, O for the computer). 
        The game indicates whose turn it is.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>HTML, CSS, JavaScript:</b> Used to create the game interface and
          implement game logic.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><b>PHP, AJAX, JSON: </b>Used to store the game state and manage the leaderboard on a server. The JavaScript logic communicates with the PHP server by making AJAX calls to the api.php file and by sending and receiving data through JSON files</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Food order web application</h2>
      <p>
        Developed in a team of 2 using a database and the approaches learnedin the CSI3140 course.
        at the University of Ottawa, this food order web application showcases proficiency in
        HTML, CSS, PHP, AJAX, JSON, JavaScript and PostgreSQL. This application consists of a web
        interface for clients to place orders which will then be saved in the database. An admin can 
        view and delete orders through the web interface.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>PostgreSQL:</b> Used as the database management system for storing order data and item information.</li>
        <li><b>PHP:</b> Implemented for server-side scripting and handling database interactions.</li>
        <li><b>AJAX:</b> Enabled asynchronous communication between the client and server for a smoother user experience.</li>
        <li><b>JavaScript:</b> Used to handle client-side logic and dynamic interactions on the web pages.</li>
        <li><b>HTML & CSS:</b> Utilized to structure and style the web application's interface.</li>
